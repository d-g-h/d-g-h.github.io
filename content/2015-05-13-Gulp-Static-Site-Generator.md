## Gulp Generated Static Site

May 2015

```js
console.log(‘alert’);
```
A site should be simple. I should be able to use a daily used language to highlight some thoughts about sharing information digitally. A site of this natural should also be not based on my sole opinion, but rather, it should be corrected, or duplicated, or replicated for general public. Source control, and centralized repository, namely GitHub at this time should help with that. Markdown should help with writing, separating presentation and the content.
